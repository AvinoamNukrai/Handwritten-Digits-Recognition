Software that recognizes handwritten numbers using Image processing and Artifical-Neural-Network

In this project I write a software that recognize handwritten digits. My software will accept an image input
Of a digit between 0 and 9 and will return as output the digit that was detected. I did this by building a model
Of a neural network. In order to implement the model itself, I've also implemented useful classes
Such as matrix, network layer and activation function. The network will reach an accuracy of about 96 percent
In digit recognition.

The software will use activation functions as ReLU and Softmax, the layer will include 4 layers till the wanted output. 

The following image Includes a bit of intuition about the software:

Enjoy!
